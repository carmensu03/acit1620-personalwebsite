      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <img src="images/my_image.jpg" alt="Picture of Carmen" height="245" width="175">
          <p> My name is <em><strong>Carmen Su</strong></em> and this is an image of me to the right. I was born and raised in Vancouver, BC.
          I speak mainly Cantonese and some Mandarin. My level of Cantonese speaking is native whereas my Mandarin
          is proficient. Mandarin was not a language I picked up when I was young. Instead, it was a
          language that I picked up when I was in grade 8. During my freetime I like to eat, game and listen to music. Jigsaw puzzles and escape
          rooms are what interest me. However, the Rubik's cube is something that falls out of the puzzle category.
