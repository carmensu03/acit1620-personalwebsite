        <p> My name is <em><strong>Carmen Su</strong></em> and this is an image of me to the right. </p>
        <p> I was born and raised in Vancouver, BC. I speak mainly
        Cantonese and some Mandarin. My level of Cantonese speaking is native whereas my Mandarin
        is proficient. Mandarin was not a language I picked up when I was young. Instead, it was a
        language that I picked up when I was in grade 8. During my freetime I like to eat, game and listen to music. Jigsaw puzzles and escape
        rooms are what interest me. However, the Rubik's cube is something that falls out of the puzzle category.
